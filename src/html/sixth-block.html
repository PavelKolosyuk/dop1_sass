            <p class="Upcoming-Event__description">When the last-minute request is for a focus group, it’s usually a sign that he
                    request originated in Marketing. When Web sites are being designed, thefolks inMarketing often feel like they don’t have much clout. Even though they’re the
                    ones who spend the most time trying to figure out who the site’s audiences and what they want, the designers and developers are the ones with most of the
                    hands-on control over how the site actually gets put together.</p>
